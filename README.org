#+TITLE: multi-keys.el

Like [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/KeyChord][key-chord.el]] but without input-method dependent. Notice that it has not
supported two continues keys such as ~hh~ so far.

Most of the commands are the same as which are in ~key-chord.el~

* Example
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq multi-keys-two-keys-delay 0.1) ; default
(multi-keys-define-global "kl" 'pyim-convert-code-at-point) ; set key
(multi-keys-unset-global "kl") ; unset key
#+end_src

* Commands
- ~multi-keys-mode~ :: toggle buffer local minor mode
- ~global-multi-keys-mode~ :: toggle global

Change its translate strategy by changing variable
~multi-keys-translation-function~. There are two translation function listed
below. See their docs for more details.

- ~multi-keys-translate-by-keysequence~ -- default
- ~multi-keys-translate-by-timer~

Other functions are the same as which are in ~key-chord.el~, except replacing
function name from ~key-chord~ to ~multi-keys~.
